##### Challenge2sep20
What was the challenge
To run a flask application in a Docker container and an sql and for both of them to communicate


How I expected the challenge to go. 

I expected the challenge to demostrate my understanding of containers and how they are used to package code and also networking.


What went well? 

I have an understanding of navigating the VM moving into the directories which was not as clear when I did the first challenge, I was able to clone the repo, vim into the file 


What didn't go as planned? 
I was unable to get the containers to communicate


Possible improvements for future challenges.

To do more research, go over the demos, study the area that are still not clear and come up with questions for clarification
